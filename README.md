### Hi All

This repository contains all the **pet projects** that I have studied/created\
in the span of 2 years and The whole idea to create this repository is to make it look like my tech resume. \
I will be adding all my projects learning or practiced in this portfolio and try to keep it up to date.

> Learning Projects:

>> These projects will have all kind of baisc ML Techniques i.e. classification, Regression and Clustering.
>> I Will be adding projects one by one in order to replenish my learning
